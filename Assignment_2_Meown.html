                    <h2>Do Cats Know Their Name?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is difficult to know whether or not a cat can recognize their own name. After all, it's not like we can just go and ask them. Cats have shown that they are intelligent, and many of them pick up on more subtle things than their name being said. Despite this, many cats ignore when people say their names. This could just be cats intentionally ignoring their owner, though. My personal experience would indicate that cats are smart enough to recognize when you are making a noise which implies you are interacting with them when you say their name, but they are not as responsive about it as a dog would be.

                    <h2>Essential Tips to Raise Healthy Cats</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is important to play with your cat(s) to give them the exercise that they need. This is especially true if you do not let your cat go outside. Not only does this keep your cat(s) in healthier shape, but it also builds a bond between cat and owner. If you have ever seen the difference between the behaviors of a cat which plays with the owner, and one that doesn't it is easy to see that the energetic one is typically more sweet towards people.

                    <h2>Why Does My Cat Attack Me?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now, energetic and playful cats do sometimes scratch people more than the ones that don't play as much, but that is just because they are very playful and go a little too far. This is not, however, the only reason a cat would attack somebody. If your cat is aggressive towards you and attacks you for seemingly no reason, this is likely because of how your relationship with the cat has grown. Try talking to the cat in a more calm voice, as tough as that may be when it attacks your Christmas ornaments. Also try to be more playful. In my experience, cats that are aggressive with people just need more attention and playtime to burn their energy. Once they are tired, pet the cat and avoid petting areas where the cat has shown sensitivity. This is usually around the neck or the belly. When you pet your aggressive cat, avoid scratching or petting too hard as the cat may respond with violence. Hopefully these tips help with your little biting and scratching machine.

                    <h2>How to Throw a Birthday Party for Your Cat</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another thing you can do for your 4-pawed friend is throw them a birthday party and celebrate holidays with them by giving them extra treats on these days. If you can convince people to bring in other cats / pets that your cat likes to hang out with, then that would also be a great thing to do for them. While cats almost certainly have no understanding of birthday celebrations, what cat is going to complain about a few more of their favorite treats and extra attention? You can also buy them toys for when you play with them.
